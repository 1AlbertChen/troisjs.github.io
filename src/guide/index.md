# ✨ VueJS 3 + ViteJS + ThreeJS ⚡

I wanted to try to write a lib similar to [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) but for VueJS.

- Repo : https://github.com/troisjs/trois
- Demos : https://troisjs.github.io/trois/

I started from scratch... I don't know if I will have time to maintain this, but feel free to participate :)

I will try to rewrite some of my [WebGL demos](https://codepen.io/collection/AGZywR) to see if this little toy can do the job.

*Trois* is a french word, it means *Three*.
